        Hi there! Thanks for coming to inspect what I wrote.
        There really is nothing fancy here. I'd love to put in 
        some fun little easter egss for anyone who comes to inspect,
        but for now, all you get is this crappy comment. (Maybe I can 
        put in a link to a crappy t-shirt too that says, "I went to 
        andrewwschwartz.com and all I got was this crappy t-shirt." 
        That would be a fun little thing I bet) Anywho, all I really did
        was copy some HTML boilerplate (not the official HTML5 boilerplate)
        and used Prettier to format everything nicely. Nothing crazy, but 
        I'm planning to use this as a foundation to later build on it when
        I have some more free time. For now this should do just fine.

        Also, while I have you here, feel free to tweet me a Spotify link 
        to your favorite song so I know that you saw this!

        -Andy
